OpenADMS Node 0.7
=================

The **Open Automatic Deformation Monitoring System** (OpenADMS) is a free and
open-source software package for sensor control and observation data processing
in geodesy and geotechnics.

**OpenADMS Node** is a monitoring system used for automated control measurements
of buildings, terrain, and geodetic nets. The software runs on sensor nodes and
obtains the observation data of arbitrary sensors, like total stations, digital
levels, inclinometers, weather stations, or GNSS receivers. The raw sensor data
is then processed, analysed, stored, and transmitted. The software can be used
to monitor objects like:

-  bridges, tunnels, dams;
-  landslides, cliffs, glaciers;
-  construction sites, mining areas;
-  churches, monasteries, and other heritage buildings.

OpenADMS Node is written in Python 3.6 and runs on a broad range of hardware
platforms, like x86, x86-64, ARM, and MIPS. The software is compatible to
desktop, industrial, embedded, and single-board computers with Microsoft Windows
Vista/7/8/10, Linux, BSD Unix, or macOS.
